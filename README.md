# Cluster_Grocery_Item
The goal of this project is look at user purchase history and create categories of items that are likely to be bought together and, therefore, should belong to the same section. We want to replave the old, manually created categories with a new ones so that each of the items belongs to just one cluster.

We are going to cluster items based on users history records. That is, create clusters of products that have the highest probability of being bought together. 

First, find the customer who bought the most items overall in her lifetime.

Second, for each item, the customer who bought that product the most.

Finally, find the best clustring categories and assign the items into these categories by using Principal Component Analysis(PCA) procedure and K-Means Clustering.
